# Create cert
dotnet dev-certs https

# Export cert to current directory, we will copy this into various directories to properly setup the cert
dotnet dev-certs https -ep aspnetcore.pem --format PEM

# Copy certificate as an trust source anchor
sudo cp -v aspnetcore.pem /usr/share/ca-certificates/trust-source/anchors/

# Update the trust list
sudo update-ca-trust extract

# Display the trust list
trust list | grep -B2 -A2 "localhost"

# Because the certificate isn't maked as CA:TRUE, update-ca-trust won't place it in /etc/ssl/certs
# Manually copy it here.  This is needed by lower level command line utilites and dotnet itself
sudo cp -v aspnetcore.pem /etc/ssl/certs/
